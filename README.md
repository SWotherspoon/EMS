anova.

## Installing

The package is easily installed from GitHub, using the devtools package. 

```R
devtools::install_github("SWotherspoon/EMS")
```

If you don't have `devtools` installed already, install it first. 

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

(EMS otherwise does not need devtools for normal use.)
